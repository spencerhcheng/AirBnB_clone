## AirBnB Clone 

### Synopsis
The goal of this AirBnB Clone project is to learn the fundamental concepts to building a web application similar to AirBnB. AirBnB. AirBnB is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging.

This portion of the project is the first step towards building the full web application; it includes a command interpreter (accessed through a console) for manipulating data and Holberton AirBnB (`HBNB`) objects.

This command interpreter is able to:
* [] - Create a new object
* [] - Retrieve an object from a file
* [] - Do operations on objects
* [] - Update attributes of an object
* [] - Destroy an object

### Environment
Our AirBnB Clone has been tested on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` using `python3` (`version 3.4.3`) and adheres to `PEP 8` style protocols. 

Tests done in VirtualBox on [Ubuntu](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64) via [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)(1.9.1)

### Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files:

|   **File**    |  **Decription**                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| console.py   | entry point of the command interpreter           |
| init_test.sh      | executes all the test files from tests folder        |
| models/__init__.py | creates an instance of FileStorage |
| models/amenity.py | class Amenity, inherits from BaseModel |
| models/base_model.py | class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes |
| models/city.py | class City, inherits from BaseModel |
| models/place.py | class Place, inherits from BaseModel |
| models/review.py | class Review, inherits from BaseModel |
| models/state.py | class State, inherits from BaseModel |
| models/user.py | class User, inherits from BaseModel |
| models/engine/file_storage.py | class FileStorage, serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances |
| tests/test_models/amenity_test.py | tests Amenity class |
| tests/test_models/basemodel_test.py | tests BaseModel class |

### How to Use The Console
First, clone the repository into your directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lisale0/AirBnB_clone

## Example of Use
Run the executable `./console.py`
```
Type `help` for a list of the commands available with `console.py`.

`help` is an action provided by default by `cmd`.

Enter `help` + `command` for information about respective command and usage.

```
vagrant@vagrant$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
